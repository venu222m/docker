ðŸ§° Essential CLI commands

ðŸ’¡ Use cases

ðŸŽ¯ Top interview Q&A

âœ… Real-Time Docker Responsibilities in DevOps/SRE
Task	Description
Containerizing Applications	Build and run Docker containers for microservices or tools
Writing Dockerfiles	Create Dockerfiles for Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
Version Control of Images	Tag images, push to DockerHub or ACR/ECR
Debugging Containers	Use exec, logs, inspect to troubleshoot
Docker Compose	Manage multi-container apps (e.g., app + db + nginx)
CI/CD Integration	Use Docker in Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions
Image Hardening	Use security scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Docker scan)
Cleanup & Optimization	Reduce image size, remove unused containers/images

ðŸ§° Most Used Docker CLI Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
# View Docker version and info
docker --version
docker info

# Build Docker image
docker build -t myapp:v1 .

# Run container from image
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name myapp-container myapp:v1

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# Check logs of a container
docker logs myapp-container

# Execute a command inside container
docker exec -it myapp-container /bin/bash

# Stop and remove container
docker stop myapp-container && docker rm myapp-container

# Remove image
docker rmi myapp:v1

# Tag and push image to registry
docker tag myapp:v1 myrepo/myapp:v1
docker push myrepo/myapp:v1
ðŸ’¡ Common Use Cases of Docker in DevOps/SRE
Use Case	Example
App Deployment	Deploy microservices using Docker containers
Local Dev Environments	Standardized dev setup with docker-compose
CI/CD Builds	Build Docker images in pipeline and push to ACR/ECR
Kubernetes Pods	Run containers as part of pods in AKS/EKS
Testing	Use containers for isolated unit/integration testing
Monitoring Agents	Run logging/monitoring tools (Fluentd, Prometheus) as containers

ðŸ§  Top Interview Questions & Answers (Docker)
âœ… Q1: What is Docker and why is it used?
A:
Docker is a platform to develop, ship, and run applications in isolated containers. It helps in consistent environments, fast deployments, and lightweight virtualization.

âœ… Q2: How is a Docker container different from a VM?
Feature	Docker	VM
Startup Time	Seconds	Minutes
Size	MBs	GBs
Resource Overhead	Low	High
Isolation	OS-level	Hardware-level
Use Case	Microservices	Full-stack OS/app combo

âœ… Q3: What is a Dockerfile? Give an example.
A:
A Dockerfile is a script to define a Docker image.

Example:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Build command:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-python-app .
âœ… Q4: What is the difference between COPY and ADD?
Command	Use Case
COPY	Basic file copy, preferred for most use cases
ADD	Can also unpack archives or download from URL (not always safe)

âœ… Q5: How do you optimize Docker image size?
A:

Use smaller base images (alpine)

Combine RUN commands

Use .dockerignore

Remove cache/temp files

Multi-stage builds

âœ… Q6: What is Docker Compose?
A:
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications using a docker-compose.yml file.

Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: redis
Start with:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up -d
âœ… Q7: How do you secure Docker containers?
A:

Use minimal base images (Alpine, Distroless)

Run as non-root user

Use image scanning (Trivy, Docker scan)

Limit container capabilities (--cap-drop)

Use secrets management (Vault, SSM)

âœ… Q8: What is the use of Docker volumes?
A:
Volumes are used for persistent data in containers.

bash
Copy
Edit
docker volume create mydata
docker run -v mydata:/app/data myapp
Useful for databases, logs, configs.

âœ… Q9: How do you troubleshoot a Docker container?
A:

docker logs <container> â€“ check logs

docker inspect <container> â€“ get metadata

docker exec -it <container> bash â€“ exec shell

docker stats â€“ monitor CPU/memory

âœ… Q10: How do you deploy Docker in production?
A:

Push image to DockerHub/ACR/ECR

Use Kubernetes (AKS/EKS) or Swarm

Use CI/CD (e.g., Azure DevOps, Jenkins) to automate build/push/deploy

Monitor and secure containers with tools like Prometheus/Grafana + security scans

ðŸ“Œ Resume Points (Docker for DevOps â€“ 3.5+ Yrs)
Containerized applications using Docker and maintained secure, lightweight Dockerfiles

Used Docker Compose for local development and testing of multi-tier applications

Integrated Docker image builds in Azure DevOps and Jenkins pipelines

Pushed images to ACR/ECR and managed version tags for promotion

Troubleshot running containers using logs, inspect, and exec

Optimized Dockerfiles with multistage builds and reduced image size by 60%
